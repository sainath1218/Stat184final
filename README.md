# Fast Food Nutritional Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores nutritional trends across major fast food chains, focusing on how calorie counts and other unhealthy attributes vary across companies. We also examine the relationship between the number of restaurant locations, sales figures, and nutritional values.

The analysis answers the following research questions:
1. How do the nutritional contents vary among the top fast-food chains?
2. Is there a relationship between the number of restaurant locations and the average calories served by these chains?
3. Is there a relationship between the sales volume of fast-food chains and their average calorie content?
